## How to run

- make sure you copy `.env.sample` files within each package that has it and put in the correct values that are listed there
- run `yarn dev` top-level (and that's it really)
- `localhost:3001` is where React app will be started by default

## Intro

- using yarn monorepo
- each folder in `packages/` is standalone package
- `api/` contains server = REST API
- `web/` contains frontend = React app
